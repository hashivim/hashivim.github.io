        <p>Welcome to the new home of Vim plugins for Hashicorp tools. These plugins were originally created by <a href="https://github.com/markcornick">Mark Cornick</a> and are seeking new maintainers and contributors.</p>

<p>If you'd like to join this organization as a maintainer of or contributor to one of these plugins, please open an issue on the appropriate repository and explain why you'd like to join. Please mention how much experience you have with Vim and the Hashicorp tool in question. Unless it's just plainly obvious that you're not a suitable maintainer or contributor, you'll likely be added to the project.</p>

<p>Please note that <strong>this organization is not affiliated with Hashicorp</strong> and you should not expect support from Hashicorp for anything here. Thanks!</p>
